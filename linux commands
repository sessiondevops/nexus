find <PATH> -type f -exec du -Sh {} + | sort -rh | head -n 5

	• Find specific GROUP files and folders in specific directory
find <PATH>-group ftpusers
find <PATH> ! -group ftpusers (not owned by specific group)

sed -i 's/\bfoo\b/linux/g' file.txt (changes will apply only on foo not on foobar, add  \b on both sides for each string )
sed -i.bak 's/foo/linux/g' file.txt (command will take a backup and apply changes on files)
find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/foo/bar/g' {} + (find and replace in all files in specific path)
